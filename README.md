## I am looking for work! 
Broadly three sorts of roles that I think I would be adept at:
1. Engineering positions which involves designing large language model agents, evaluating said models/agents, prompt engineering, model fine-tuning, and python-based pipeline development.
2. Research-y positions related to improving model reasoning, search and retrieval, capabilities & safety evaluations, and preference/value alignment in large language models.
3. Operational or managerial positions that demand a combination of technical and non-technical skills, wearing many hats, computing risk and making calculated bets, managing communications and people, scaling an organization, and so on!

A few notable projects:
1. [knightsGPT](https://github.com/AsteroidHunter/knightsGPT): Can a GPT-2 variant trained on millions of games *learn* how to solve the knight's tour puzzle? 
2. [replicatingAlexnet](https://github.com/AsteroidHunter/replicatingAlexnet): PyTorch-based replication of the classic paper Krizhevsky et al. (2012).
3. [Thermal modeling of (99942) Apophis](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/PSJ/ac66d1): We used the non-linear optimization and a markov chain monte carlo algorithm to constrain the physical properties of the near-Earth asteroid (99942) Apophis. 
4. [Tucson Effective Altruism](https://linktr.ee/tea_at_ua): An organization I co-founded and scaled. Our improved capcity enables us to run a university course, upskilling programs, research-styled symposia, and weekly community events.
