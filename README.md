### 👾 A few illustrative projects:
1. [knightsGPT](https://github.com/AsteroidHunter/knightsGPT): Can a GPT-2 variant trained on millions of games *learn* how to solve the knight's tour puzzle? (Spoiler: yes!)
2. [replicatingAlexnet](https://github.com/AsteroidHunter/replicatingAlexnet): PyTorch-based replication of the classic computer vision paper, [Krizhevsky et al. (2012)](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2012/file/c399862d3b9d6b76c8436e924a68c45b-Paper.pdf).
3. [Thermal modeling of (99942) Apophis](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/PSJ/ac66d1): We used non-linear optimization and a markov chain monte carlo algorithm to constrain the physical properties of the near-Earth asteroid (99942) Apophis. [Other publications here.](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WGDJUkoAAAAJ&hl=en)
4. [Tucson Effective Altruism](https://linktr.ee/tea_at_ua): An organization I co-founded and scaled. Our improved capacity enables us to run a university course, upskilling programs, research-styled symposia, and weekly community events.
